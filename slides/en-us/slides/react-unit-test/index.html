            <p>Here's an example of what I'm talking about. If you write a custom 'sum' function in React, you've almost certainly got a corresponding unit test to make sure that your custom function accurately does what it promises to do. Notice that this 'sum' function is completely isolated from the web view that the user can see, or even some higher level function of yours that depends on the fact that 1 plus 2 does, in fact, equal 3.
