            <p>I see a lot of unit tests out in the wild that may or may not truly be "unit" tests in the strictest sense of the word. Since any test is better than no test, I hesitate to criticize tests that might not be as isolated as I'd prefer in an ideal scenario.
            </p>
            <p>But here's one definition of a unit test that I hope that we can all agree on -- unit tests are for the benefit of the developer, not the user. As much as I'd love it, I've never had a user ask me how much code coverage I have for the website I'm demoing, or how many edge cases I've tested for null pointer exceptions. While users certainly benefit indirectly from a solid coverage of unit tests, I'd argue that developers are the most direct, primary beneficiaries of unit tests.</p>
