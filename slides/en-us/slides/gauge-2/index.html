            <p>So, remember Gauge? That was the whole reason we started having this conversation in the first place, right?

            <p>Now that we have a better understanding of what unit tests are and who they are written for, let me say this: Gauge DOES NOT replace your current unit testing library of choice. Gauge is for writing user-focused tests, not developer-focused tests. Gauge is for writing User Journey tests.
