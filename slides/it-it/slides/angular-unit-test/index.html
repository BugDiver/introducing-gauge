            <p>Here's another, slightly more realistic example in Angular. The developer has created a 'Lightswitch' component, and like all good responsible developers do, they have created a corresponding set of unit tests to test this component in isolation.
            </p>
            <p>From the end user's perspective, they are ticking a 'use default shipping address' widget on screen, or 'bill to credit card on file'. They most definitely benefit from having a well-behaved Lightswitch component, but when you look at the tests, it's pretty clear that they were written for the benefit of the next developer who comes along and stumbles into this part of the codebase, not the end user who will actually be interacting with the Lightswitch directly.</p>
