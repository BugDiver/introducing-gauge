            <p>Gauge is for writing User Journey tests. Capture the words your end users use, and the steps they take, in plain English Markdown files. Implement the tests in the language of your choice. Show them easy-to-read reports, proving to them that your web app does exactly what they ask it to do.
            </p>
            <p>If you're already writing unit tests, this is your chance to level up and start thinking like a user instead of a developer. Are you up to the challenge?</p>
