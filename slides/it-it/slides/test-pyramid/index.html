            Unit tests are a crucial part of the quality equation. They form the foundation of the Test Pyramid. Since most web developers write their own code, these unit tests allow them to test their own code. They're typically fast to run and easy to write, since they are designed to run in isolation from the other, more complex parts of the application stack (like databases and web services).
            </p>
            <p>I often say that unit tests "test the bricks, not the building". After all, you can't trust the building if you don't trust the bricks.</p>
            <p>As you move farther up the Test Pyramid, you move farther away from the source code, and get closer to the actual users of your application. (Keep this in mind when we begin talking about User Journey tests.) You add more pieces to the puzzle, and correspondingly add more places for your tests to fail.

            <p>
            If your organization doesn't have a solid testing or integration environment -- one that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible, and one that is trivial to set up and tear down repeatedly as you run your integration tests -- this is where testing can become less common. Not because the tests are less important, but sadly because they can be harder to run reliably.</p>
